Hi there, my name is Joost van 't Zand. This page serves as a bit of an overview of me and my online presence.

Some things I like in no particular order are: neat algorithms, beautifully ugly hacks, automating things, deconstructing things, well-structured information, programming, reverse-engineering, lists.

I am currently working as a Security Analyst at [Qbit][1] in Delft.
